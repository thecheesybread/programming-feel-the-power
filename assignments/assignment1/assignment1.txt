GETTING STARTED:

Log in using your username and password
Open the "Terminal" program (use the search)
If Terminal is not on the dock, put it there

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE TERMINAL:

The Terminal program is just another way to navigate your files and folders.
It looks scary because it's text-based. But it's actually really simple!
Just type a command and press RETURN to see the results.

For example, type "ls" (stands for "list") and then RETURN.
This should list the files and folders in your current folder.

If you want to move into another folder, type "cd" followed by the name of the
folder. For example, "cd Library" (followed by RETURN) will move you into the
"Library" folder.  cd stands for "change directory." Directory is just another
name for folder.

In order to get back to where you just were, type "cd .."
".." just means "the directory that contains the current directory".

Hint: the TAB key autocompletes names of files and folders. So you can type
"cd Lib" and then TAB and the command should turn into "cd Library".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PYTHON INTERPRETER:

In the Terminal, type "python" to enter the Python interpreter (it doesn't
matter what directory you're in). Now whatever you type will not be navigating
your file system but will rather be run as a Python program. In other words,
we're in CODE MODE. Note that "ls" and "cd" no longer work. But we can type
anything that's a valid Python expression!

Try typing the following things (press RETURN after each line):
  2 + 3
  24 - 3 * 5
  "never eat " + "soggy woofles"
  "amazing!" * 5

You'll notice that the interpreter functions as a basic calculator, among other
things. Sequences of words enclosed in quotation marks are called "strings".

Now try typing these:
  foo = 23
  foo
  bar = 50
  foo * 2
  foo + bar

foo and bar are called variables. Notice that they store values that you can
use again later. It doesn't matter that we called them "foo" and "bar", you can
just as easily make a variable named "baboon", for example. Also, variables can
hold any Python data type, not just numbers. Try storing a string in a variable!

Experiment with the interpreter for a bit. Can you cause it to error? How?
When you're ready to leave, press CTRL+D to return to the "shell" (that's just
another name for the Terminal).

Playing around with the interpreter is a great way to test simple Python
programs. The problem is, once our programs get more complex it will be
cumbersome to type them into the interpreter line by line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PYTHON FILES:

Therefore, it's time to learn how to run programs from a file. Basically what we
will be doing is typing a sequence of Python commands into a text file, and then
"running" the entire file after we're done.

Let's start by organizing our folders a bit. Back in the shell (the Terminal),
type "cd" and press RETURN. This will move us back to our "home" directory.
You can type "ls" again to see what's in here if you want. Now, we want to make
a new directory called "work". The command to make a directory is "mkdir". So
type "mkdir work" (followed, as always, by RETURN). Now, the "ls" command should
show our new work directory.

Do "cd work" to move into this new directory we just made. The "ls" command
should show nothing now, since "work" is currently empty.

Let's fix that. Don't close the Terminal, but open Aquamacs (use search again).
If Aquamacs is not on the dock, put it there.

Aquamacs is just a text editor like Microsoft Word, except Aquamacs is made for
writing code instead of essays. Therefore it has some nifty features like
formatting and coloring our code for us.

Type the following line into Aquamacs:
print "Hello, world!"

Save the file in the "work" folder you just made, and name it "hello.py".

Now go back to your Terminal window. If you're still inside the "work" directory
and you type "ls", you should now see the file "hello.py".
Type "python hello.py" to execute the code inside the file. You should see
"Hello, world!" show up in the Terminal. If so, you just successfully ran your
first python program from a file. Congratulations!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOK WORK:

It's time for some book work. You're ready for it.

Go to http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

Read "The Hard Way Is Easier". Really read it. This is important.

For all exercises:
Type out the exercises! As a general rule, only copy-paste long strings (in
other words, only copy-paste the stuff between quotation marks). Typing out the
rest of the program makes ALL the difference in how much you learn. I'm serious
about this. Don't just copy-paste the exercises.

The Study Drills are optional, don't worry too much about them.
DO read the Common Student Questions, and make sure you understand the answers
to them.

If you feel like you need more review, do exercises 1-4. If not, just do
exercise 4 to make sure you fully understand what we taught you earlier.

Now do exercises 29-31. This is new material. Ask for help if you get stuck!
Note: Tabs are important. Make sure you get all the tabs right.
Another note: Exercise 31 includes some notation (in particular, the raw_input
function) that you haven't seen before. Try to figure out what this does by
running the program, but ask if you need help!

See an instructor once you're done with the exercises to get checked off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATBOT:

Go to the course website and download assignment1.zip into your work directory.
Navigate back to your work directory in the Terminal and type
"unzip assignment1.zip" to unzip it.

The assignment1 directory should now appear in your work directory.
"cd assignment1" to get inside it. "ls" to see what files it contains.
The only file you need to edit is "chat_bot.py". Open this file in Aquamacs.

Fill out the file chat_bot.py according to the comments inside.

When you're done, see an instructor to get checked off.
